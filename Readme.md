# Anabot, your friendly neighborhood anagram robot

A Tumblr Markov bot that - wait for it - makes anagrams (using Python and some stuff)

## Which snake do I use

I use Python 2.7

## How to do

Mark.py contains a python program that builds a markov chain with the training text and outputs it in mark.json. Ana.py contains the actual Tumblr bot.

## What if it doesn't do

You can contact me by combining the bones of an arctic hare, the wings of a slightly confused dragonfly, and allspice and letting simmer under a full moon. Or you can submit an isse.
